# WebCompat Issue Dashboard
The project is aimed to be a webcompat.com issue dashboard. With the dashboard, contributors is able to know the issue status easily without browsing all the issues one by one.
Plan of the dashboard is going to provide 2 features:
 ## Issue-Bug dependency graph
 Visualize the dependency of webcompat.com issue and bugzilla bug. We can know in a period, the issues depends on which bug, maybe a good way to know if there is a regression issue.
 You can visit [here](https://webcompat.herokuapp.com/wc-bz.html) to see how it works.
 ## Trending Issues (Under construction)
 Visualize the trending of incoming issues. We can know in a period, the issues comes from same domain, or same root cause? 
Welcome to give me any input or idea you want, that will help us to fix the broken web!
